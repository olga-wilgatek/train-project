             <h2>About me</h2>
             <p>I am a graduate student of Wroc&#322;aw University of Economics. I studied Business Informatics, including courses such as IT project management, System Analysis and Desing, Databases, Business Process Modeling and Internet Application Development. I am interested in web application development, business process and data analysis. Besides, my interests include languages - I am fluent in English and studying Spanish, German and Swedish. Learning, gaining knowledge and experience in aforementioned fields is an important matter in my life making me feel fulfilled. </p>
             <p>This project is a skeleton for a train connection searcher. It does not contain any logic yet. It allowed me to learn HTML and CSS with elements of UI.</p>
